# threejs-projects
small projects using three.js with stuff I made in Blender!    
see them here: https://syncopika.github.io/threejs-projects/    
    
To run this project:    
- assuming you have node.js and npm installed, `cd` into this repo after you have downloaded it and run `npm install`. this should create a new node_modules directory containing all the javascript dependencies noted in package.json
- then run `node server.js`, which launches an Express.js server to serve this project
- open up a broswer and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`
- you should see the projects! :D
    
Each project directory also has a readme with some additional info.      
    
Thanks for visiting and checking this project out! Feel free to use any of my .gltf assets in your own projects as well if you want - no attribution necessary. If you spot any bugs, please feel free to create a new issue. I would prefer no PRs at this time though, please (sorry!).
