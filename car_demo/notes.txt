for car turning physics later to make things more realistic/complicated:

What I want to do is to program at least somewhat realistic turning for the car.
I thought to start with I could just rotate the car to match the rotation of the front wheels. this is tricky because
I'm having trouble figuring out how a car's body rotates when turning. it should be independent of the front wheels' rotation I think?

TODO:
 - fix the car rotation thing when turning. if you try turning the wheels from one side to another (i.e. keep alternating between
   A and D) after turning, the car's forward vector is stuck at an angle, which influences the forward movement. I think it has
   to do with the if condition I set up to determine whether the car should rotate to align with the front wheels. need to investigate
   further though.

 - fix lateral rotation. it kind of works but I still don't know what situations trigger the car to flip over, which happens sometimes.
   additionally, when you try to move the car along the big sloped turn, the lateral rotation usually looks pretty ok but then it looks
   as if the car got rotated about the Z axis where it's tipped forward at an angle. 

   I think car.rotateY in move() might be the culprit. when the car is tilted about X, rotating Y can have such a consequence
   possibly (cause the axes will be tilted as well?)
