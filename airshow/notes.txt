airshow!

I love airshows and military aircraft. the one featured here is an f-18. hopefully I will build some more military aircraft to assemble
some static displays! :D


notes:
- so when the f-18 controlled by the user reaches some vertical angle, the camera changes and if the rotation is correct, 
  the axes can 'flip' and so normal control is inverted. (rotation meaning you align the local f-18 axes with the group it's in's axes)
  note that the camera also changes when that axes flip occurs. if we can prevent that, that'd be neat.

  looks like the issue is with lookAt()
  this might help: https://discourse.threejs.org/t/solved-lookat-flips-cam-rotation-180-degrees-how-do-i-remove-this/2066/3

  this dicussion also looks interesting: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/1460

todo:
- get a runway, a hangar, better lighting + clouds
- basic f-18 animations like:
	- flaps
	- rudders
	- landing gear deploy/retraction on key press
- takeoff/landing logic??
- make more planes for static displays! 
	-ideas: c-17, c-5, f-15, f-16, c-130, f-14 (even though retired lol), f-22, f-35, av-8b, p-8, tanks are good too
