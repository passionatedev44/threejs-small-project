airshow!

I love airshows and military aircraft. the one featured here is an f-18. hopefully I will build some more military aircraft to assemble
some static displays! :D

todo:
- get a runway, a hangar, better lighting + clouds
- basic f-18 animations like:
	- flaps
	- rudders
	- landing gear deploy/retraction on key press
- takeoff/landing logic??
- make more planes for static displays! 
	-ideas: c-17, c-5, f-15, f-16, c-130, f-14 (even though retired lol), f-22, f-35, av-8b, p-8, tanks are good too
