# character demo    
    
For this project I wanted to explore character movement!    
    
## notes:    
    
1. terrain adjustment    
Adjust the y-position of the character depending on its change in elevation. To do this I take the initial y-position as a baseline value for being leveled with
the ground by placing a 'dummy' object placed in the middle of the character at a height around where the head is and raycasting downwards.    
    
2. first person camera rotation vs third person camera rotation
    
3. weapon attachment
    
4. added an animation controller
Animating with several actions became a bit difficult quickly without having an additional object to help.
