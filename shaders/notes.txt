notes
might need to grab the uv coords of my imported model and pass them to the shaders? https://jsfiddle.net/f2Lommf5/16541/ 
-> nope, just needed make sure the texture's flipY was set to false

colors for rgba channels in shaders range from 0-1, not 0-255!! somehow I didn't notice that even when the alpha channel was set to 1 and I
wasted a ton of time trying to figure out why different colors weren't working -_-.
